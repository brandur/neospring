<h1>neospring</h1>

<p>
    This is an installation of <a href="https://github.com/brandur/neospring">Neospring</a>, an implementation of
    the <a href="https://github.com/robinsloan/spring-83">Spring '83</a> protocol.
</p>

<p>
    If this is <a href="https://neospring.brandur.org">neospring.brandur.org</a>,
    then it's run <a href="https://brandur.org">by Brandur</a>
    (<code>brandur@</code> my domain) and hosts my board, which you can request like
    so:
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        $ curl https://neospring.brandur.org/2c98169d0b6fa73cab5a830be8dde53c5f388d5c6f8e6f756b6b6dbcc83e1124
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    Board TTL is configured to be {{.BoardTTLDays}} days, as recommended by the specification.
</p>

<p>
    Server code is written to be highly available and for robustness, and has a
    comprehensive test suite, but so far has little real-world vetting so far,
    so use with caution.
